## ✨ How It Works

1. **Tell your dream**  
   Example:  
   > "I dreamt I was flying over a shimmering city, feeling happy and nostalgic."

2. **AI interprets your dream**  
   - Understands feelings (e.g., excitement, nostalgia)
   - Looks up dream symbols & music moods

3. **Create music plan**  
   - Picks instruments (string, piano, synth…)
   - Sets mood and speed
   - Writes music sections (intro, verse, chorus, etc.)

4. **Generate & explore**  
   - Hear your music 🎶
